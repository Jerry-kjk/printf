# printf Project

printf is a function used to print formatted output to the console or other output devices.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A __README.md__ file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory.
- Your code should use the __Betty__ style. It will be checked using __betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl__.
- You are not allowed to use global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- In the following examples, the __main.c__ files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own __main.c__ files at compilation. Our __main.c__ files might be different from the one shown in the examples.
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called __main.h__.
- Don’t forget to push your header file.
- All your header files should be include guarded.
- Note that we will not provide the ___putchar___ function for this project.

## GitHub

There should be one project repository per group. The other members do not fork or clone the project to ensure only one of the team has the repository in their github account otherwise you risk scoring 0%.

## Compilation

Your code will be compiled this way
